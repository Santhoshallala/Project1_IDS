Automated intrusion detection systems face significant challenges, particularly in dealing with
the high dimensionality inherent in intrusion detection datasets. The existing classifiers often struggle
to deliver high accuracy and efficiency, leading to increased false alarms. The problem of high
dimensionality in automated intrusion detection systems has arisen due to network data's increasing
complexity and diversity. As network environments evolve, the volume and intricacy of features used
for intrusion detection grow, making it challenging for traditional classifiers to maintain high accuracy
and efficiency. This necessitates the exploration of advanced techniques, such as Random Projection,
to effectively handle and extract relevant information from high-dimensional datasets, thereby
addressing the emerging challenges in intrusion detection. The proposed methodology involves
leveraging the NSL-KDD dataset to benchmark intrusion detection systems. Initially, traditional
classifiers are trained using the complete feature set to establish a baseline. Random Projection is
introduced as a dimensionality reduction technique to address the challenges of high dimensionality.
This involves applying Random Projection and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the feature set
and training classifiers with the reduced dimensions. Bayes-Net, Naive Bayes, J48, PART, and Random
Forest are five distinct classifiers commonly employed in machine learning for classification tasks. This
research endeavours to drive advancements in intrusion detection systems by leveraging novel
Machine Learning techniques such as kernel-PCA and LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis). These
innovative approaches hold promise in enhancing the capabilities of intrusion detection systems,
offering opportunities for improved accuracy and effectiveness in identifying and mitigating security
threats.
